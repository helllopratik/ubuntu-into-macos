# Electron & Chrome/Chromium Note:
echo "[i] For Electron/Chrome/Chromium-native apps, button location cannot be controlled at system-level, only by their theme or startup flags (or custom patching)."
echo "[!] Most Electron apps follow their own button layout and may not match GNOME's."

# Button colors: For true colored macOS-style buttons, you must use a GTK/Window theme like WhiteSur, macOS-3, or McMojave that provides colored button icons. GNOME and most Linux WM don't let you color the buttons individually via gsettings alone.
echo "[i] For colored 'traffic light' buttons, please use a macOS-like GTK theme such as WhiteSur."
